# FriendFinder

### Overview

For this project I built a full-stack site that takes in results from the users' surveys and compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### Guidelines
1. Provide 10 questions for the survey
2. Use the following npm packages: express, body-parser, and path
3. A file that includes routes to display html pages
4. A file that should include the following two routes:
   * one that will display a JSON of all possible friends
   * a route that will handle incoming survey results and compatibility logic
5. Display results as a modal pop-up
